# hello-world
first repository
Hi! I am new to Github.

I have interests in programming from classes that I took at Colorado State University. I am four months away from gaining my B.S. in Information Technology and would like to have a stronger knowledge of programming.  I have found myself wandering over here to Github and here I am.
